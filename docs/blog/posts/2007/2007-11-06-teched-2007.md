Yesterday I arrived in Barcelona for TechEd 2007. I followed already some interesting sessions about [LINQ](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/netframework/aa904594.aspx), it brings you closer how you can access data in a more intuitive and more object-oriented way (data = objects). I really like [LINQ to SQL](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/bb425822.aspx), one of the drawbacks, is that it can only be used against a SQL Server database. If you need to target another database and program against a conceptual model (not a 1-1 mapping with your datatable structure and objects) you can have a look at [LINQ to Entities](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa697427(vs.80).aspx).
