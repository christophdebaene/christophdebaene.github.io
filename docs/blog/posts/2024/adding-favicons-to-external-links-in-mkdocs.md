I've developed a MkDocs plugin called [mkdocs-link-favicon](https://www.github.com/christophdebaene/mkdocs-link-favicon), designed to facilitate the automatic generation of a favicon before each external link. You can observe the functionality of this plugin on this website.

This plugin is highly customizable, allowing users to use their own icons, exclude specific sites, and even choose to open external links in a new tab. For detailed information and installation instructions, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/christophdebaene/mkdocs-link-favicon).
