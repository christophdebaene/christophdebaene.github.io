The Microsoft [Patterns & Practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/) Team recently released a new version of the [Web Client Software Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=websf) that can be found on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/). One of the things I noticed directly, is that they implemented a web version of the [Composite UI](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c) based on the [ObjectBuilder](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=ObjectBuilder).

The goals of Web Client Software Factory are:

- CAB for Web
    - Hiding complexity
    - Separation of infrastructure & biz logic
    - Biz logic reuse amongst different UI Technologies
    - Promoting consistent development practices
- Navigation
- UI Richness
- UI Layout management
- State management
- Best use of technology available (Ajax, WinForms controls, ...)
- Security
- SaaS implications on application design

More information about the vision & scope can be found [here](http://www.codeplex.com/Project/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=websf&DownloadId=2266).
