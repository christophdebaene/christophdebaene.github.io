[Tom Hollander](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/) revealed some features/scenarios about the upcoming [Validation Application Block](http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2006/11/27/validation-application-block-revealed.aspx) that will be included in Enterprise Library v3. There are already some validation libraries available, for example

- [.net Validation Framework](http://www.codeplex.com/ValidationFramework)
- [Validation Application Block](http://www.codeplex.com/VAB) (another one)
- [An Object Level Validation Framework](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ValidationFramework.asp)

The fact that you can define rules through configuration is really cool. I can't wait for the CTP!
