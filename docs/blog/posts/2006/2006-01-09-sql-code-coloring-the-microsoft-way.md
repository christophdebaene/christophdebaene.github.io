title: SQL Code Coloring - The Microsoft way

Some years ago on a project I needed a usercontrol for code coloring SQL statements. At that time I reused a dll library that is used inside the query analyzer of SQL server. I wrote a little [article](http://www.istaysharp.net/Article.aspx?id=006) about that topic, I think it gives some useful information about COM interop in .NET.
