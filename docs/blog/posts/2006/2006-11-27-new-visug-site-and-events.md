VISUG has a brand new [website](http://www.visug.be).Â All the necessary features are already available and more functionality is coming soon. The two last VISUG events for year 2006 are announced. One of the events is a panel discussion about exception handling and logging, and it will take place at [Real Software](http://www.realsoftware.be/default.htm) (my home). The other event is a geek dinner where we can discuss about... you know what I mean ;).

**Topic:** Discussion on Enterprise Exception Handling and Logging **Description:** This is a session where you (yes, you!) can discuss exception handling and logging in enterprise applications. Bring your tips and tricks, problems and exception handling frustrations with you, and we'll all learn about best practices together! No slides or preparation required! Don't want to discuss? No problem, you're not required to say anything, but we hope you will. To help with a smooth discussion, it will be lead by a panel of 3 to 4 people. If you're interested to sit on this panel, you're invited (First-come, First-served basis). **When:** Monday 11 December, 18:30 - 20:30 **Where:** [Real Software](http://www.realsoftware.be/) (Prins Boudewijnlaan, 2550 Kontich, [Route](http://www.realsoftware.be/contact/default.htm)) **Register:** [VISUG](http://www.visug.be) website

See you on both events!
