The [patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/) team introduces a new project, called **B**aseline **A**rchitecture **T**oolkit (BAT). It's a collection of carefully selected, designed, and integrated guidance assets which include:

- Reference Implementations
- Application Blocks (such as CAB and EntLib)
- Hands-On-Labs
- How-Tos
- Guidance Automation Packages automating common tasks
- Documentation bringing all the parts together and describing the rationale behind the key smart client design recommendations.

The toolkit provides an effective way for architects, dev leads and developers to create high-quality baselines for their smart client applications, addressing non-trivial design and development challenges. The toolkit will provide reusable assets, guidance and examples for solving those challenges in the most common scenarios. Also, the guidance will be open and customizable, so you will be able to adjust it to your specific needs.

There is a [Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=941d2228-3bb5-42fd-8004-c08595821170) released on [GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/) and it will be updated every 3-4 weeks and is based on the [CAB](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c).
