I must have missed that one, but some weeks ago, version 3.0 of Windows Desktop Search for Windows XP/2003 has been [released](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917013). If you need to search in netwerk files you can download [Windows Desktop Search: Add-in for UNC/FAT](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f7e981d9-5a3b-4872-a07e-220761e27283&displaylang=en). If you want to recognize more filetypes, check out the [IFilters](http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.DesktopSearchIFilters) page on [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/).
