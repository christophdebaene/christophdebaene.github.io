Here are some interesting blogs that are dedicated to Virtual PC

- [VirtualMachine](http://blogs.virtualserver.tv/blogs/virtualmachine/default.aspx)

There are some fundamental features in Virtual PC that you really have to look at. For example differencing disks, see [HOWTO: Use Virtual PC's Differencing Disks to your Advantage](http://andrewconnell.com/blog/articles/UseVirtualPCsDifferencingDisksToYourAdvantage.aspx) and you can also compress your VHD files, see [Compact Your VHD Files](http://msmvps.com/blogs/anguslogan/archive/2005/07/31/60046.aspx#comments).

!!! tip

    On several keyboard layouts and for example on a AZERTY belgian keyboard you need the [Alt Gr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_Gr) key for the backslash square brackets, etc. Inside Virtual PC the ++altgr++ key doesn't work, therefore you can use an alternative for the ++altgr++ key, which is ++ctrl+alt++.

!!! info "Update"

    There is a [hotfix](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;899474&sd=rss&spid=2957) now for the ++altgr++ problem.
