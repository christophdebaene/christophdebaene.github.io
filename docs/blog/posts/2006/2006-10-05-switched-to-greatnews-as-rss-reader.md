Recently I switched from [RSSBandit](http://www.rssbandit.org) to [GreatNews](http://www.curiostudio.com/) as RSS reader (noticed by a [post](http://bertjansen.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D9B33D4A940B6FFD!134.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&_c=blogpart#permalink) from [Bert Jansen](http://bertjansen.spaces.live.com/)).

The speed for aggregating feeds using GreatNews is really fast! I think it was better called SpeedNews ;). Besides that, it has a nice user-interface and all config & feed data is kept in the installation folder. This means that no installation (MSI) is required, and that it can easily be deployed to other computers.
