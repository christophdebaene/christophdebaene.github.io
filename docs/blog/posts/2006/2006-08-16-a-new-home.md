It has been quiet for some time on my blog, but that will change now. It was mainly due to the fact that we bought a new house in Hombeek, we didn't know that little village before :). Every weekend we spend time on painting and some chores. But the fact that we moved now, and that practically everything is done, I can again spend more time for programming and sharing with the community.
