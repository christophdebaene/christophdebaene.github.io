[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is a free linux-based operating system. Ubuntu works very well on [Virtual PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx), and I didn't encounter any problems during installation. A detailed step-by-step explanation can be found on the [documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UserDocumentation) site of Ubuntu, [How To - Configure Ubuntu for Microsoft Virtual PC 2004](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToConfigureUbuntuForMicrosoftVirtualPC2004).

Setting Ubuntu to the same screen resolution as the host in full-screen mode didn't worked for me. I tried the following [post](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=129379&postcount=21), but without any success.

One of the reasons for installing Ubuntu, was to see if my blog [site](http://www.christophdebaene.com/blog) rendered correctly in Firefox. Only the line under the post title was not positioned correctly. I will update the `business` theme soon.
