DasBlog 1.9 is [released](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog19Released.aspx). It's a major update with a lot of extra features and fixes. I contributed to this release for improving DasBlog in a multi-user setup. The following features has been added (will update the documentation on [dasblog.info](http://www.dasblog.info)):

- **Top Posters** macro & **Profile Combo** control
- Every admin/contributor can create/edit a personal **profile page**
- A Contributor can be notified by mail for certain events and can be configured through the **'User Settings'** screen
    - Notify when a new post has been added
    - Notify when comments has been added for ALL posts
    - Notify when comments has been added for OWN posts

I also created a new theme called _'business'_, which is running on my [weblog](http://www.christophdebaene.com/blog) now. It's not yet included in this release, but it's available through the [subversion repository](http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=127624). I am also planning to create a theme, based on _'business'_, for in a multi-user setup.

Soon I will update [RealDN](http://www.realdn.net) (corporate blog of my [company](http://www.realsoftware.be) I am working for) to DasBlog 1.9.
