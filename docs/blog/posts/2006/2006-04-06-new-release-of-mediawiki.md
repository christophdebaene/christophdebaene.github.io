title: New release of MediaWiki
date: 2006-04-06
---

I am planning to install [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) for my site [www.istaysharp.net](http://www.istaysharp.net). This way I can easily add/update content, because currently the site is static, and that's thre reason why it's not updated frequently.

It was planned for this evening to update [www.istaysharp.net](http://www.istaysharp.net), but a new version has been released of MediaWiki, version 1.6.1. I hope the upgrade will go smooth and that my code will still work :)

One other interesting point, is that apparently there is an experimental support for connecting to an Oracle database (read [release notes](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Release_notes/1.6)). Are there any plans for supporting MS SQL Server 2000? If so, please let me know!!!
