This year I purchased a server for persisting my data and for running applications that require intensive processing. For me it was very important to have a robust & performant way for archiving my data. Therefore I purchased a RAID card from [Areca](http://www.areca.com.tw/), the [ARC-1120](http://www.areca.com.tw/products/html/pcix-sata.htm). The raid card is connected through 8 HD's of 200GB from [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) in RAID 5. Areca is currently one of the best RAID cards available. This [page](http://print.tweakers.net/?reviews/536) contains an extended review with benchmarks

My initial idea was to use my current [ASUS A8N-SLI Deluxe](http://www.asus.nl/products/mb/socket939/a8nsli-d/overview.htm) motherboard, which has 2x PCI-E Express ports, and to use one port for the RAID controller. At that time it was still not possible, but now [ASUS](http://www.asus.com/) has provided a new BIOS driver which fixes the [issue](http://60.248.88.210/faq/index.php?action=article&cat_id=001&id=32&lang=en&highlight=A8N%20sli%20deluxe). After a lot of research and certainly the many chats I had with Bruno, I decided to go for a server motherboard. This is simply the most recommended way and is more robust, uses [registered memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_memory), has PCI-X ports, dual CPU, more memory slots, etc.

I wanted a server motherboard that contains dual CPU core support and featuring one or two PCI-E ports. This way I can easily upgrade in the future if it is necessary. Therefore I purchased the [Tyan K8WE](http://www.tyan.com/products/html/thunderk8we.html), which is an NForce Pro based server motherboard with 2x PCI Express x16 slots @full speed x16 lanes and has even a firewire connection.

A lot of hardware components means a large case. Therefore I decided to buy the [U2-UFO](https://mountainmods.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_32&products_id=77) case from [Mountainmods](https://www.mountainmods.com/). It's really a case with a lot of space and most important it can contain up to 9 HD's and it's compatible with an Extended ATX motherboard.

I am still configuring the server, but I will certainly post some benchmarks and experiences. In the mean time you can find the specs and some pictures of my server.
