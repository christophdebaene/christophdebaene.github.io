The session 'Turn Left or Right? How to Best Design Your Web Services Interface' at [TechEd](//www.mseventseurope.com/teched/05/pre/content/default.aspxâ€œ) was very interesting and pointed issues like versioning, contracts, interfaces, etc.

[Christian Weyer](http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/christian/default.html) from [ThinkTecture](https://www.thinktecture.com) is currently building a tool called [WSContractFirst (WSCF)](//www.thinktecture.com/wscf) that can generate code from a contract. [Dealing with the "Melted Cheese Effect"](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/meltedcheese.asp) is an article on MSDN about this subject and more parts will be published.
