I am looking forward to [TechEd Amsterdam 2005](http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/05/pre/content/default.aspx). No doubt that it will be a great experience and there will be a lot of interesting seminars given.

And do not forget to register to the [BeLux Country Drink](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/teched/)!
