This weekend I visited [CeBIT](https://www.cebit.de). It was a long trip due to road works and heavy rain, but it was worthwhile. There was a lot of people, but thankfully CeBIT at the Messegel√§nder in Hannover has about 30 halls. In one of the first halls, there was an exclusive car from Bugatti. Surprisingly there was no pricing indicated :-)

I think it was at the expo from AOpen that a couple of case-mods were shown. One of the most original one was certainly this one:

One of the manufactors that i didn't want to miss was [Asus](https://www.asus.com). For me there were 2 things that caught my attention: the new A8N SLI Premium which is the succesor of the [A8N SLI Deluxe](http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8nsli-d/overview.htm) and of course a DUAL Geforce 6800 Ultra on one board. As you can see the board is huge and I don't think it will fit on every motherboard and/or case, but it's still a prototype of course.

One of the things I focused on, was SATA PCI-Express RAID cards because I am planning to buy one for my system. The most well known RAID card in this category at this very moment is [Areca](http://www.areca.com.tw/), who were present too. The card that I am planning to buy is the [ARC-1220](http://www.areca.com.tw/products/html/pciE-sata.htm) with 8x SATA ports.

[HighPoint](http://www.highpoint-tech.com/) showed also their latest products and in particular the RocketRaid 2320, which is an 8 channels PCI-Express to SATA II host adapter. The new products are included in the product guide that I took from the stand at CeBIT. The products they showed are listed [here](http://www.highpoint-tech.com/booth.htm).

I also went to [3Ware](http://www.3ware.com/), and they told to me that the PCI-Express RAID cards will be released by November of this year.

It was a long weekend, and I spent most of the time in the car but it was fun and interesting. See you at CeBIT 2006 :-)
