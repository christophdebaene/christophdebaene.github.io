Today I published the new [IStaySharp.NET](http://www.istaysharp.net/). It's rewritten in ASP.NET 2.0 and hosted by [WebHost4Life](http://www.webhost4life.com/). I also added a new [FAQ](http://www.istaysharp.net/Article.aspx?id=003) entry about coverting [FILETIME](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/filetime_str.asp) and [DateTime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdatetimeclasstopic.asp), you will encounter FILETIME when you are using COM interop.

There is a lot of coming during the next months. So stay tuned!
