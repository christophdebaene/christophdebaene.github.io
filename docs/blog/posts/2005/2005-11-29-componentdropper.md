Today I released an add-in for Visual Studio .NET 2005 that allows you to drag components onto the designer surface. It's called [ComponentDropper](http://www.istaysharp.net/Article.aspx?id=903) and you can even watch a [movie](http://www.istaysharp.net/Articles/Binary_903/RazorToolbox.wmv) to know what it does and how to use it.

A very good tool for screen capturing is [Windows Media Encoder](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx). It's from Microsoft and you can download it, if you have a legal version of Windows XP.

> Windows Media Encoder 9 Series is a powerful tool for content producers who want to capture audio and video content using the many innovations in Windows Media 9 Series including high-quality multichannel sound, high-definition video quality, support for mixed-mode voice and music content, and more.
