If it depends on [Shawn Burke](http://www.shawnburke.com/default.aspx?document=1) (Developer Division Program Manager) it must be possible to ship the Windows Forms source code and PDBs in version .NET 2.0. More information about that great idea can be found on the [blog](http://www.shawnburke.com/default.aspx?document=185&userinterface=9)
