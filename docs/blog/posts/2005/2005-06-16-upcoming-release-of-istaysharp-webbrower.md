In the course of next week I will release a new version of [IStaySharp.WebBrowser](http://www.istaysharp.net/). It contains new features, fixes and the set of properties and methods are made compatible with the webbrowser control in VS.NET 2005 (e.g.: EnableBack, DocumentText, ObjectForScripting, etc.).

New Features:

- Implemented the [Travel Log](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/browser/webbrowser/webbrowser.asp) interface
- Easy communication between Javascript and .NET through the 'ObjectForScripting' property
- NUnit tests
- Improved model for extending the Site (IOleClientSite) of the webbrowser.
- Fixes and improved functionality for Mozilla
- Printer service for modifying header, footer and margins
