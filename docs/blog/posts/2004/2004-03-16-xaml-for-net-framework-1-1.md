title: XAML for .NET Framework 1.1

Today you see a lot of XAML-like implementations for .NET framework 1.1. **XAML** (pronounced "Zamel") is part of AVALON in Longhorn and it allows you to describe the layout of applications. Basically, you describe via XAML-tags your controls, events, etc. it's very intuitive.

One of the projects is **wfml**. You can find the article with the source code [here](http://windowsforms.net/articles/wfml.aspx).

Another project which is still in beta is [xamlon](http://www.xamlon.com). Closer to the release date **Xamlon** will be licensed per developer.

An implementation under the [BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) is [MyXaml](http://www.myxaml.com)Â and it is increasingly successful. I think I will first play around with this implementation. An [article](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/xmlGuiGenerator.asp?target=myxaml) from the author of **MyXaml** can be found on [CodeProject](http://wwww.codeproject.com/)

I think the developers who first implemented the concept were [ic#code](http://www.icsharpcode.net/). They setup a library **XmlForms** which can be downloaded [here](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sharpdevelop/099bsource.zip?download) and is used in [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx).
