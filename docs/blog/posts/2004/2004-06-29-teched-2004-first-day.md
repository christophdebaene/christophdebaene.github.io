The first opening key note was very entertaining and refreshing. There was an introduction of the team services in VS.NET, a demo with 3d-glasses on a 64-bit platform, a promising project called [SkyServer.org](http://www.skyserver.org/), announce of the **Express** edition of VS.NET, and many other things.

It's very well organized, everybody at TechEd receives a login where you can check your email, surf on the internet, you receive a bag with a huge set of goodies and documentation, etc.

I just returned from a session of [FABRIQ](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?ID=B4FCF02F-3E71-4A15-A305-F0511240EEC1) which can be downloaded on GotDotNet and it's a very nice messaging architecture that can be interesting on the project I am currently working on. So, be prepared Tom, Franco and Peter when I come back to Belgium :)

Now we are going to eat something...
