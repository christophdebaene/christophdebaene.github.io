I think one of the most popular code snippet tools is [Code Library for .NET](http://dotnet.4all.cc/). I don't know how it's with the current version, but all previous versions IÂ tested were very unstable. But it really has all the features I need for a code snippet tool.

I found some other code snippet tools named [CodeKeeper.NET](http://www.dasain.com/news.htm) and [SnippetBox.NET](http://www.snippetbox.net/). It's surprising that the two sites are very similar, just search/replace of some text :-). Unfortunately it's not for free.

I wonder what you guys use as code snippet tool...
