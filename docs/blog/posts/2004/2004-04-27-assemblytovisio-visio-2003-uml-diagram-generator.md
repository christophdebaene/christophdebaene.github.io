Now you don't need anymore the architect edition of Visio to generate your UML diagrams from an assembly. Now you can use [Assembly2Visio](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=375f1eea-c60c-4cbe-ac12-1335899c6566) from [GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/).

It has the extra feature that you can use regular expressions to filter class names and its totally integrated in Visio 2003 through a macro. Nice tool!
