I started with an open-source project called [Neo4jConnect](http://neo4jconnect.codeplex.com/) that enables you to connect to [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/), which is a graph-database written in Java and accessible through the [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) api. On [this](http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-server/milestone/rest.html) page you can find the several operations exposed by Neo4j through REST. Neo4jConnect exposes an object api to manipulate the graph database.

More information and a quickstart can be found on the project [site](http://neo4jconnect.codeplex.com/).

In the next couple of weeks I will add more documentation and features!
