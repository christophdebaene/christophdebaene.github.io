Today I needed to install extra stuff on my VPC, but it turned out that there was not enough space. [Donn Felker](http://feeds.feedburner.com/donnfelker) blogged a nice [article](http://blog.donnfelker.com/post/Resizing-a-VHD-and-a-Volume.aspx) how you can resize your VHD, I followed all the steps and It worked like a charm.
