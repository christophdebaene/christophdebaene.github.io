After some investigation, I discovered that GitHub uses a library called Linguist to create language breakdown graphs, and these graphs are recalculated every time changes are pushed to a repository. You can find more details on this process here.</p> <p>The source code for my project is located in the <code>docs</code> folder, and unfortunately, this folder is excluded from the Linguist analysis.</p> <p>To address this issue, you can override the Linguist settings by adding a <code>.gitattributes</code> file to your repository. More information about the possible customizations can be found here.</p> .gitattributes<pre><code>docs/** -linguist-documentation\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>Note the use of the minus sign (\"-\") before <code>linguist-documentation</code>, which ensures the inclusion of all files and directories in the <code>docs</code> folder.</p> <p>You can test these settings locally using a Docker image for Linguist. Simply navigate to your repository in <code>PowerShell</code> and execute the following command:</p> <pre><code>docker run -t --rm -v ${pwd}:/repo crazymax/linguist:latest\n</code></pre> <p>This Docker command allows you to simulate the Linguist environment locally and verify whether the language bar is being generated correctly.</p> <p></p>","tags":["GitHub"]},{"location":"cheat-sheet/javascript/","title":"Javascript","text":""},{"location":"cheat-sheet/python/","title":"Python","text":""},{"location":"cheat-sheet/typescript/","title":"Typescript","text":""},{"location":"cheat-sheet/windows/windows/","title":"Windows","text":""},{"location":"cheat-sheet/windows/windows/#environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","text":""},{"location":"cheat-sheet/windows/windows/#access-through-a-shortcut","title":"Access through a shortcut","text":"<ol> <li>Right-click blank area of your computer desktop and select <code>New -&gt; Shortcut</code></li> <li> <p>In the <code>Create Shortcut</code> window type</p> <p><code>%windir%\\System32\\rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Click <code>Next</code> and give it a name like <code>Environment Variables</code> </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/#github","title":"GitHub","text":"<ul> <li>Language bar not showing on GitHub repository</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#mkdocs","title":"MkDocs","text":"<ul> <li>Adding favicons to external links in MkDocs</li> </ul>"}]}
